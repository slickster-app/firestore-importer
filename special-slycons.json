We will be taking to the streets every Wednesday at 6.30pm, and Saturday at 8.00am\nLeaving from our store on 47th and 5th (579 5th Ave), and lead by ASICS 5th Ave staff, runs will vary in length, distance and speed. We'll take you down East and West River paths, through trendy neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Queens, and cool down back at the store or at a fun destination to refresh and relax.Join the crew. Explore the city. Be part of the community.\nIndividual run plans below!\n\n\nRun Schedule: \n\n\n\nWednesday: July 18th\n\n\nThe Run: 4.5 miles, including warm up and cool down.\nBenefits: Builds strength, focuses on good and efficient running form, and helps build speed endurance.\n\n\n\n\n\nSaturday: July 21st\n\n\nThe Run: 9 mile run. Westside highway to Riverside Park.\nBenefits: Continuation of building muscle strength and endurance to prepare for longer mileage races. Speeds up metabolism, burns calories, strengthens heart and endurance.\nTHE COURSE:  http://bit.ly/2ugMTAw\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaturday: July 28st\n\n\n\n\nThe Run: 10 mile run including intervals \nBenefits: It will train your tired legs to pick up and slow down the pace.  \nThe course:  Heading down the East River path towards lower Manhattan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWednesday: August 1st\n\n\nThe run: 6 mile run through Central Park:\nThe benefit: As training builds up it’s great to work in speed runs. This run helps activate the fast twitch muscles and helps runners learn to mentally and physically pace through proper breathing and body posture.\n\n\n\n\n\nSaturday:August 4th\n\n\nThe run: Summer Streets Run, 10- 12 miles, including 7 miles of open streets with no cars.\nThe benefit: As this point the body is getting use to the long run routine. You will start to see the mental benefits but you will likely still be getting used to the heat in the early training. Hydration during these long stretches will be very important. Your body is breaking itself down and is desperate for hydration and food. As a result, we will focus education on nutrition. We will use these long runs to learn what you like and do not like before your race.\n\n\n\n\n\nWednesday:August 8th\n\n\nThe run: The Ladder workout.\nThe benefit: You will start to crave the change in pace. Light mileage in these speed runs are a nice change from running on your own. The mental benefits will be equal to how your body is feeling. Runners will notice weight andappetite changes.\n\n\n\n\n\nSaturday:August 11th\n\n\nThe run: 10+ miles around Central Park.\nThe benefit: Familiarity and consistency. Running in large groups of people even when not part of your crew can be a huge benefit. Competitiveness starts to creep in. This will be time to test your speed and mental fortitude. Use this to see where your training has brought you so far.\nTHE COURSE:  http://bit.ly/2uvGAYW\n\n\n\n\n\nWednesday:August 15th \n\n\nThe run: 3 miles on the Westside highway.\nThe benefit: Endurance is key to long training runs. Speed is showing up in these workouts. The workouts are not getting easier but you will be getting better.\n\n\n\n\nSaturday:August 18th\n\nThe run: 12+ miles, Queensboro Bridge to Roosevelt Island. This will bethe longest run so far.\nThe benefit: This run will keep you familiar with the parts of your run that are never easy, like bridges. Bridges are a smart way to work through the lactic acid build up and tired legs. Staying hydrated on a long run is also importantin your training. Stay focused on the prize. Mentally think about what your goals are and the effort you have put in so far. You will see it paying off!\nTHE COURSE:  http://bit.ly/2ujRphv\n\n\n\n\nWednesday:August 22\nThe run: 5 miles. This run takes us across town to 60th St & 1st Ave.\nThe benefit: Time to check your fitness. Your body is ready and tuned for this. Conscious of where you are today vs. 6 weeks ago?\n\n\n\n\n\nSaturday:August 25th\nThe run: 12+ miles. Lower Manhattan loop. We will go west on 47th towards the West Side Path, following that path all the way around until we connect to the east river path.\nThe benefit: It’s just a long run. Sweaty and necessary to improve your running speed and fitness.\nTHE COURSE:  http://bit.ly/2uk6yiZ","startTime":1533767400,"status":"live","url":"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/asics-run-club-movewithasics-tickets-48039928720?aff=ebapi"},{"isReservedSeating":false,"locale":"en_US","isOnlineEvent":false,"subCategoryId":"8001","venuId":"24781148","stopTime":1533771000,"isLocked":false,"name":"Free Run Club with Chelsea Piers Fitness","currency":"USD","imageURL":"https://img.evbuc.com/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F44126192%2F254618538186%2F1%2Foriginal.jpg?h=200&w=450&auto=compress&rect=0%2C142%2C600%2C300&s=c8b8904d5b2b4f095fe58e98123c8dff","venu":{"fullAddress":"265 Schermerhorn Street, Brooklyn, NY 11217","address":"265 Schermerhorn Street","city":"Brooklyn","id":"24781148","country":"US","lon":-73.98345130000001,"postalCode":"11217","lat":40.6879896,"region":"NY","name":"Chelsea Piers Fitness"},"id":"47693536652","vanityURL":"","desc":"Join Chelsea Piers Fitness Brooklyn for a Weekly Open-Level Run\nWhether you’re training for a distance, or just looking for a fun regular course, Chelsea Piers Fitness has your back!\nMeet at our club, located at 265 Schermerhorn Street in Brooklyn, at 8am on Saturdays or 6:30pm on Wednesdays. All levels are welcome, but be prepared for at least a 5k.\nAfter the run, join us back at the club for private gait + stride analysis by Coach Lindsay.\nNo Run Club on May 19 (Brooklyn Half Marathon), May 26 (Memorial Day Weekend) or July 7 (4th of July).\n\nCoach Lindsay Ritchings is an experienced runner who has trained and competed at a variety of distances.

Other times, the occasion rises to us. Both could be<br> said about Dispatch, one of the country&#39;s most successful independent bands, and their<br> forthcoming album, America, Location 12. Built on tales of struggling immigrants, forgotten<br> veterans and children cast aside, Dispatch (Brad Corrigan, Chad Stokes and Pete Francis) has<br> crafted a set of songs that tap into the peace and plight of the human condition, chiseling a spot<br> in our culture that has perhaps never been quite so vital. Their sixth full-length LP, America,<br> Location 12, marks a return to form – and a path to the future – for the trio whose music has<br> always made us take stock of our place in the world, and forced us to remember that the first<br> pillar of social responsibility is to be kind and decent to one another. And, beneath it all, to find<br> moments of joy and inspiration that sometimes only music can provide.<br> It&#39;s impossible to deny that few bands – at any level – have been able to achieve what<br> Dispatch has: three sold-out shows at Madison Square Garden to raise funds for Zimbabwean<br> humanitarian efforts, world tours and a 2004 concert in Boston that drew 110,000 fans. But<br> Dispatch never felt bound by their success, and over the past decade they have focused as<br> equally on solo projects and non-profit work as what they could create as a trio. America,<br> Location 12 comprises eleven songs that show a Dispatch here for the long and messy haul,<br> oozing with their signature energy and a new urgency in a time when a moment wasted is a<br> moment too long.<br> &quot;It&#39;s been like a part-time job, moonlighting with each other,&quot; says Stokes about the<br> band&#39;s status up until a year and a half ago, when they decided to go from occasional tours to a<br> new kind of commitment. “If we&#39;re going to be in this band together, let&#39;s really do it. We have a<br> lot more appreciation for each other as a trio now. And we saw an opportunity to sing songs<br> about issues that were of a real concern to us socially.&quot; Corrigan agrees. &quot;We didn&#39;t want to turn<br> into a nostalgic band that just plays every now and then,&quot; he says. &quot;We really wanted to<br> reconnect with our fans.&quot;<br> To make America, Location 12, the band enlisted John Dragonetti (The Submarines) as<br> producer and Mike Sawitzke (Eels) as engineer and decamped to a mythical setting in Northern<br> California: Stinson Beach&#39;s Panoramic House, a studio isolated by miles of winding roads and<br> packed with found objects and ethereal beauty. &quot;We were recording as the surrealism of the<br> election hit,&quot; says Corrigan. “Despite the circus of it all, we were still holding on to hope with<br> candidates who prioritized caring for refugees, the environment, and dealing with social justice<br> issues head on. But when that hope ended up eclipsed by the divisiveness of the election, we<br> threw ourselves even more fully into the songs to embed our hope and anguish there. The energy<br> inside and outside the studio was just so surreal in that window, but I do think ultimately it helped<br> us create an album rife with urgency, honesty and self-reflection.”<br> &quot;It&#39;s always been important to us as a band to take a stand on social and political<br> concerns,&quot; says Francis. &quot;Now, it felt like this sense of activism seeped into the songs in ways<br> they never had before. We couldn&#39;t ignore everything that was bubbling around us.&quot;<br> But in true Dispatch fashion, they made sure to release a first single, &quot;Only The Wild<br> Ones,&quot; that is focused not on fight, but on freedom. Set to a rhythmic, African-inspired groove, it&#39;s<br> a song with a nod to one of Jack Kerouac&#39;s signature passages from On the Road and praises<br> those who barrel through each day with an unbounded quest for joy and truth. Stokes was singing<br> about two men from his college days who could hop a freight train one moment and cavort<br> around New York City the next, but it&#39;s really a reminder that the best life is lived off in the world,<br> not online.<br> Like &quot;Only The Wild Ones,&quot; much of America, Location 12&#39;s inspiration came from<br> Stokes&#39; vast internal catalogue of literature and art, and his uncanny ability to meld details from<br> the past and present of his own life – and the world at large – to make unforgettable stories that<br> hit at the heart. Knowing that the time had come for a new Dispatch album, their first since 2012&#39;s<br> Circle Around the Sun and perhaps their most &quot;deliberate&quot; in over a decade, Stokes decamped to<br> a small cottage in the middle of winter with not much more than a wood stove and endless<br> inspiration, from 14th century poetry, to a magazine donning Bob Dylan on the cover to<br> newspapers reflecting the rise of a terrifying new populist sense of power. It was there he wrote,<br> as material poured into the songs – songs that were then shaped into the final product with the<br> help of his bandmates. As a result, America, Location 12 is both imaginative, tearful and topical,<br> and almost startlingly cogent at times. &quot;The songs are more focused,&quot; says Francis. &quot;They&#39;re<br> laser-beamed.&quot;<br> Adds Stokes, &quot;There are all sorts of parallels, and it makes sense it is happening now.<br> For whatever reason, it felt like some of those issues that I wrote about are now really intense<br> issues. Everything feels like it&#39;s coming to a head. If we can be a band in today&#39;s climate that<br> brings these issues up in a non-traditional way, then that&#39;s really fulfilling for us.&quot;<br> The results range from gorgeous, heartbreaking odes to children in Central America who<br> must flee from gang violence in search of a better life (the Beatles-tinged &quot;Rice Water&quot;); to the fire<br> and fury of the album&#39;s opener &quot;Be Gone,&quot; written about the plight of Native Americans who are<br> often forced to the fringes; to the tender &quot;Curse and Crush,&quot; about a family member who passed<br> away and how we must center on the most basic palate of life that we all share. &quot;We fight and we<br> fuck and we make up,&quot; they sing in soft harmony to a locomotive beat. And then there are tracks<br> like the thunderous &quot;Skin The Rabbit,&quot; full of ponderings about a world in disarray that builds to<br> deep, rallying cry.<br> &quot;For us, it&#39;s always been best to be for something rather than against something else,&quot;<br> says Corrigan. &quot;When you make statements that are for things, then people can really rally<br> around it. Strength in numbers still wins.&quot;<br> Dispatch has been known, since the band&#39;s inception in 1996 in Boston, as being more<br> than just about the music – they&#39;ve constantly directed their energy to causes and campaigns<br> along the way. Apart from their work as a trio, Stokes also created a non-profit, Calling All Crows,<br> that joins bands and fans together in collective activism that&#39;s raised more than a half a million<br> dollars, and Corrigan has been at work on Love Light + Melody to amplify the stories of children<br> who live in extreme poverty. As they tour to support America, Location 12, beginning in June at<br> Red Rocks in Colorado, Dispatch is sure to find new ways to engage their fan base in the issues<br> that matter most.<br> Dispatch heads into the era of America, Location 12 with both the passion and vigor of a<br> band in their infancy and the knowledge and power of one together for twenty years and counting.<br> In a world where hope is in short supply, fear runs rampant and alternative facts blare louder than<br> the truth, we need, more than ever, music that is honest. And Dispatch is rising to the occasion.<br> &quot;I think what we are most excited about for our band is the commitment we made.<br> Because the best art is still yet to come,&quot; says Corrigan. &quot;It&#39;s fun to get back on the ship together.<br> Hopefully we are a stronger band than ever before.&quot;<br> This event is all ages","startTime":1532037600,"cityName":"New York","postalCode":"10021","url":"http://newyorkcity.eventful.com/events/dispatch-nahko-and-medicine-people-raye-zaragoza-/E0-001-112037007-2?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"title":"Mortuary Drape (21+ Event)","venueUrl":"http://newyorkcity.eventful.com/venues/saint-vitus-bar-/V0-001-010659506-5?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","latitude":40.7367758,"regionName":"New York","venueName":"Saint Vitus Bar","id":"E0-001-114077561-9","countryName":"United States","longitude":-73.9551337,"venueAddress":"1120 Manhattan Ave","desc":"","startTime":1532041200,"cityName":"Brooklyn","postalCode":"11222","url":"http://newyorkcity.eventful.com/events/mortuary-drape-21-event-/E0-001-114077561-9?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"title":"Pat Martino Trio Plus Horns","venueUrl":"http://newyorkcity.eventful.com/venues/jazz-standard-/V0-001-000966599-7?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","latitude":40.7422962,"regionName":"New York","imageURL":"//d1marr3m5x4iac.cloudfront.net/images/large/I0-001/037/006/640-7.jpeg_/pat-martino-trio-plus-horns-40.jpeg","venueName":"Jazz Standard","id":"E0-001-114071536-1@2018071919","countryName":"United States","longitude":-73.983777,"venueAddress":"116 East 27th Street","desc":"","startTime":1532043000,"cityName":"New York","postalCode":"10016","url":"http://newyorkcity.eventful.com/events/pat-martino-trio-plus-hor-/E0-001-114071536-1@2018071919?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"title":"New York City Lights Dinner Cruise - Weekday","venueUrl":"http://newyorkcity.eventful.com/venues/hudson-river-park-pier-40-/V0-001-011515318-0?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","latitude":40.7304781,"regionName":"New York","venueName":"Hudson River Park - Pier 40","id":"E0-001-099737191-9@2018071919","countryName":"United States","longitude":-74.0111636,"venueAddress":"92 Hudson River Greenway","desc":"Hornblower’s New York City Lights Dinner Cruise is the ultimate way to experience the best New York has to offer from a whole new perspective.

It's a mix of a good workout, serene environment and stunning skyline! Wear water-friendly bottoms and bring your camera, if you desire. No experience is required. \nAll are welcome (friends of Fulbright/guests too) but space is limited, so make sure to RSVP!\nWhat: Fulbright NY Goes Kayaking on the HudsonWhen: Sunday, July 8, 1:45pm-3:30pm(Note that due to popularity, there's also a date in June to go kayaking)Where: Pier 84 Boathouse, 555 12th Avenue at 44th Street RSVP: RSVP required (click \"Tickets\" to choose from the ticket options: $50 for foreign/current Fulbrighters, $60 for Fulbright alumni & friends of Fulbright)\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQ):\nWhat should I wear?Be prepared to get wet (although you might not). We HIGHLY recommend that you bring a change of clothes for afterwards, because your clothes may get soaked. Your paddling clothes should be water-friendly, like a swimsuit, spandex, synthetic, or Dri-Fit materials. Don’t worry about your feet: either bring water shoes if you have them or go in your bare feet. Cotton clothes, jeans, or flip flops aren’t recommended. Remember to bring a reusable water bottle, snack, and sunscreen. Manhattan Kayak sells waterproof phone cases, sunscreen, sunglasses straps, and water-friendly t-shirts/shorts/hats if you need them, and they also provide a lock for your locker.\nWhat if the weather is bad?We'll be watching the weather and will email you at least 2 hours before the outing if it’s going to be cancelled. While a light rain is ok (after all, we'll be getting wet anyway), high winds (15+ mph winds) or lightning can be dangerous, so in the event that this kind of weather occurs, we’ll offer you a refund.\nIs it safe?We will have a guide from Manhattan Kayak, so when going out on the river, our guide will be nearby and watching over us. Each paddler will wear a lifejacket and must listen and stay near their guide. \nMore questions?

We’ll pass a string of new landmark buildings: Renzo Piano’s Whitney Museum, Frank Gehry’s IAC Building, and Jean Nouvel’s detail-clad 100 11th Avenue. We’ll pass the remnant of Pier 54 (where the Titanic survivors disembarked the Carpathia) which now frames the location of Barry Diller’s future “island oasis in the Hudson.” Chelsea Piers, peeks at the human parade traversing the High Line, and the massive construction overtaking the Hudson Yards—these are all along the way as we approach the colossus of the midtown skyline. We’ll settle in at the end of Pier 84 at 44th Street for the sunset, then off to a neighborhood eatery to enjoy the company of the new friends we’ve met. Sunset 8:29pm.\n \nTHE MEET UP: Take the 1 Train to Christopher Street or the A, B, C, D, F to West 4th Street (exit at the north end of the station)—walk west on Christopher Street toward the Hudson River.

Approximately 3 mile walk.\n\n\n\n                                                          \n\n\nGENERAL INFORMATION\n\n\nWHY WALK WITH NEW YORK CITY WILD! RATHER THAN HEADING OUT ON MY OWN WITH A SUBWAY MAP AND A GUIDEBOOK?\nAn “urban wilderness” walk is not an oxymoron. Keith Michael has been exploring the remotest corners of New York City for decades, gaining a collective eclectic knowledge that cannot be found in any guidebooks. These walking tours will bring you to his favorite destinations around this vast metropolis, taking the guesswork out of the legwork! With carefully researched information about where to go, what to see, how to get there, AND the camaraderie of fascinating people to enjoy the \"there\" with, each excursion provides a unique off-the-grid out-of-the-tour-bus immersive experience in the natural wonders (as well as architectural and historical highlights) available within one of the largest cities in the world. Once you do, you’ll be inspired to do even more and take advantage of the myriad other FREE tours offered by many parks and organizations throughout NYC—there is always more to see and learn!\n \nHOW DO I RESERVE MY SPOT?\nFollow instructions on the Eventbrite site. \nSee the full schedule and descriptions of the 2018 NYC Wild! Walking Tours by clicking HERE!\nTo see the short list of dates and destinations, scroll down to the bottom of this section—with LINKS to each New York City WILD! Walking Tour to reserve your spot NOW!\n \nHOW MUCH DOES IT COST?\nThere are various ticket prices for New York City WILD! Walks. Buy an \"Early Bird\" Discount ($10 - only 5 available), a $15 One Day Wonder Ticket, or Become a NYC Wilder! The $50 Pass gives you access to six months of upcoming NYC Wild! Walks June through December 2018 (Get the PASS in June for ONE FREE MONTH) - what a deal! BUY the PASS as a Great GIFT IDEA too!\nPLEASE NOTE: Participants cover their own public transportation costs (NYC Metrocard and PATH train fares) as well as lunch/dinner and beverages—either a bring-your-own-picnic or conviviality at a local eatery depending on the individual walk itinerary.\n \nWHAT IS THE BAD WEATHER AND REFUND POLICY?\nBAD WEATHER: Trips will only be cancelled under extreme weather conditions. New York City weather is fickle! Rarely does the same kind of weather last all day, and the weather forecast for Central Park may be vastly different than what actually occurs on a far outer-borough beach. Most walks will go on rain or shine under the optimism that an inclement forecast will change. However, primarily beach walks WILL BE cancelled or rerouted if there is any threat of thunderstorms.\n\n\nCANCELLATIONS: Participants will be notified by e-mail 24 hours in advance if a forecast of extreme weather is imminent. You will recieve a FULL REFUND of your ticket OR you can transfer your order to another New York City WILD! outing by contacting newyorkcitywild@gmail.com. (A REFUND can take 7-10 business days for your refund to be processed.)\n\n\n\"No Shows\" WILL NOT be refunded.\n\n\nAny request for a refund must be made within 4 days after an event has ended.\n\n\n\n \nWHAT ABOUT MEET-UP LOCATIONS AND NYC PUBLIC TRANSPORATION?\n\n\nPlease carefully note meeting places and times. Trips will leave promptly from designated meeting sites. For meet-ups on a subway platform, we will generally leave on the FIRST TRAIN after the designated departure time. Return times are approximate. \n\n\nNYC Wild! Walks are GREEN in more ways than one! Walks frequently meet on a subway platform to take a train (average 45 minutes to an hour+) to and from the starting point of the walk. Please carefully note whether the meet-up location is on the UPTOWN or DOWNTOWN platform AND whether it is at the FIRST or LAST car of the train! Please arrive with a filled MetroCard so that trains or buses are not missed while you wait in line to put more money on your card.\n\n\nAlternate meeting locations can be arranged en route to the destination if this is more convenient for individual travelers.\n\n\nALWAYS check the MTA Weekender online before you leave home for planned service changes on your subway lines! Leave additional travel time for delays in weekend service. Some Walk meet-up locations or destinations may be changed if subway service is unusually cumbersome to our starting point.\n\n\n \nWHAT ELSE DO I NEED TO KNOW?\n\n\nTo get to the \"cool places\" that we go on New York City WILD! Walks, these outings are estimated at 4-6 hours in length (including travel time to and from the starting point of the actual walking tour) and range from 2-5 miles depending on the itinerary. Know your own abilities and stamina.\n\n\nIt is difficult to catch up with the group if you are late - please be on time for the MEET UP. Most walks are a loop so it is also difficult to leave early. Please take this into consideration.\n\n\nNYC Wild! Walks move at a casual pace to encourage observation and conversation. These ARE NOT \"exercise walks\" or \"power walks\" or \"hiking.\" Pauses for photography are accommodated though sometimes we may need to keep moving to fulfill the walk's itinerary.\n\n\nThese walks are usually not suitable for participants younger than 10 years of age.\n\n\nMost NYC Wild! excursions follow primarily level established trails though the walking surface can vary from city sidewalks to woodland path, boardwalks, grass, minor rock scrambling or sandy beach. Some stairs or a rise and descent in terrain are part of individual walks.\n\n\nInsects should be a minimal concern, but mosquitoes, ticks and bees DO EXIST in New York City. Be mindful and take suitable precautions.\n\n\nRestrooms are not always conveniently located or available. Take this into consideration.\n\n\n \nWHAT SHOULD I BRING?\n\n\nBRING YOUR OWN LUNCH/DINNER. We will stop for a picnic along the way—outside. Bring your picnic with you rather than expecting to stop along the way to \"pick something up\". Some walk itineraries may include end-of-walk conviviality at a local eatery—watch the listings for these scheduled festivities. Please note: For these get-togethers, to reduce end-of-the-evening hassles, we will split the check and 20% tip evenly among the number of diners. If someone feels that they have consumed significantly more or less than the general table, adjustments can be made. Please be generous.\n\n\nWater\n\n\nDress appropriately for the forecasted weather—hat, jacket, layers to take off or put on if temperatures change. In general, it can be windier and cooler (or hotter) at these locations than in Manhattan. Bring an umbrella for surprise changes in weather.\n\n\nSturdy closed-toed walking shoes that you aren’t too concerned about getting muddy or wet. No sandals or flip-flops.\n\n\nBinoculars if you have them. If not, we will share.\n\n\nA camera. Each walk offers endless photo opportunities.\n\n\nSun screen and insect repellent. Insects should be a minimal concern for most trips.\n\n\nPLEASE use your cell phone sparingly for emergencies only (and generously for taking memorable photos of the walk!)\n\n\nEnthusiasm and a sense of adventure.\n\n\n \nDO I NEED TO SIGN A LIABILITY WAIVER?\nYES. You will be asked to sign a liability waiver statement, agreeing to release and hold harmless Keith Michael and New York City WILD! from any and all liability arising out of or resulting from your participation. Your participation in these walks is on a completely voluntary basis and you are responsible for your own personal safety and well-being. Read the complete statement included with this event listing.\n \nHOW DO I GET MORE INFORMATION?\nWrite to newyorkcitywild@gmail.com for any additional information. All outings are available for private walks, group bookings, or other events. When making inquiries, please indicate the date and destination of the walk for which you have questions. More detailed information about each walk will be sent by e-mail to participants a few days before each scheduled outing.\n \nWHO IS THAT NEW YORK CITY WILD! GUY?\n\nKEITH MICHAEL is a self-styled urban naturalist, avid birder, photographer, and a dedicated explorer of New York City's five boroughs. He has led 100s of walks throughout NYC. Watching birds drives his focus, but the breadth of NYC history, and the wealth of vistas, trees, wildflowers, grasses, mushrooms, butterflies, dragonflies, as well as scaled, slithery and furred fauna that can be observed within the city is truly remarkable. Mr. Michael has published four books of writing and photographs: Let’s Go Out!: A Birder's Year in the West Village (2015); Take Me to the River (2014); Once Around the Block (2013), and 1000 Days: World Trade Center Rising (2013); leads New York City WILD! nature walking tours, co-leads Hudson River Park WILD! walks, and is a monthly contributor to WestView News: The Voice of the West Village. \nWhen not adventuring in the city and taking photographs, Mr. Michael is a ballet choreographer, having created The Alice-in-Wonderland Follies, Mother GOOSE! and The Nutcracker for New York Theatre Ballet, and is the Dance Production Coordinator at The Juilliard School.

The official album release show will premiere at the musician-founded multimedia art venue (Le) Poisson Rouge in New York City on July 26, 2018, with special guest Elliott Skinner of Thirdstory. \n“I’m extremely excited to be preparing to release [GO TiME: Brooklyn 2], which features the latter half of the GO TiME: Brooklyn live show inside the Systems 2 recording studio. Fans on our tour and online loved the dynamism and audio quality of the music in the first CD, plus the ability to watch the professionally filmed video footage online whenever they want,” Kelly says. “This second album keeps those same core elements while pushing the envelope musically to explore the sonic world where jazz meets electronic, contemporary, and pop influences.”Songs from [GO TiME: Brooklyn 2], which will include “Gracified” covers of classic Rolling Stones and Ray Charles hits, have already been seeing significant traction online. BuzzFeed Video’s Facebook clip of “Fish and Chips,” a dancing saxophone duet with Leo P of Too Many Zooz, has garnered over 395,000 views since mid-May. The new album will include the full track and video of “Fish and Chips” as well as the soulful fan favorite “Feels Like Home,” which was recorded as a duet with the aforementioned Elliott Skinner.\n\nFeatured by Vanity Fair as a millennial shaking up the jazz world, Grace Kelly’s genre-defying music and inventive digital content are pushing her to the forefront of the fusion scene, alongside names like Snarky Puppy, Jacob Collier, Cory Henry, Robert Glasper, Jon Batiste, and Too Many Zooz. Her snackable PopUp video series combining soulful sax solos with unexpected and exotic locales has over 2 million views, further establishing her brand as an artistic veteran with a digital native’s flair for innovation. [GO TiME: Brooklyn 2] is Kelly’s 12th album as a bandleader. The Brooklyn recording studio event was broadcast on Facebook Live in March; online footage from the show currently boasts over 100,000 views and hundreds of positive comments and shares.\nFor further information about Grace Kelly, visit her website at www.gracekellymusic.com on Facebook at facebook.com/GraceKellymusic, on Instagram at instagram.com/gkellymusic, or Twitter at @gracekellyPAZZ. \n\n\nRefund Policy & Terms of Service: LPR does not issue refunds or exchanges for ticket purchases. All sales are final.

The view of the ocean. The sound of a rainforest at sunrise. The smell of an open-air market. The embrace of the wild human experience. However, maybe the nostalgia for a certain place might be attributed instead to a feeling, or a time, or even a person. Sometimes, inspiration stems from a place that everyone can relate to, but maybe no ones actually been. This is the music of The Hip Abduction, the vibrant St. Petersburg, FL-based collective that formed over a mutual appreciation for West African and early Jamaican reggae/dub music.The Hip Abduction (THA) began through informal jam sessions and quickly coalesced into a sound that attracted national attention. For Gold Under the Glow, the bands third full album released on March 11, 2016, THA engage an indie pop acumen alongside a highly emotive and roots driven sound. Recorded in Nashville, Gold Under the Glow was produced by Dabney Morris (Wild Cub) who is credited with incorporating synth-pop teeth into the bands global foundation and summery vibe. Its a smart blending of world pop and club aesthetics that appeals to both audiences. The Hip Abduction featuring David New (lead vocals, guitar), Chris Powers (bass), Dave Johnson (baritone, tenor sax), Cody Moore (keyboards, sax), Matt Poynter (drums, vocals) and Justino Walker (guitar, vocals, sitar) have shared stages with the likes of Grace Potter, Galactic, The Revivalists, Ziggy Marley, Umphreys McGee, Thievery Corporation, Matisyahu, 311, Galactic, and Moon Taxi and has performed at Shaky Knees, FloydFest, Wanee Music Festival, Suwannee Hulaween, Deep Roots Mountain Revival, Sunfest, Orange Blossom Jamboree, Tropical Heatwave Music Festival, The BIG What? and more.Watch out for more festival plays in 2018 including Red Rocks Amphitheater, California Roots Festival, Blue Plum Festival, Camp Bisco, Duck Creek Log Jam, Camp Deep End and more as well as coast to coast dates.","startTime":1532629800,"cityName":"New York","postalCode":"10002","url":"http://newyorkcity.eventful.com/events/hip-abduction-/E0-001-115431612-1?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"title":"Alika","venueUrl":"http://newyorkcity.eventful.com/venues/lincoln-center-for-the-performing-arts-/V0-001-005352386-1?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","latitude":40.7724641,"regionName":"New York","venueName":"Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts","id":"E0-001-114159094-5","countryName":"United States","longitude":-73.9834889,"venueAddress":"10 Lincoln Center Plaza","desc":" <p><strong>Atrium 360° </strong><p> <p>With music that blends roots, reggae, hip-hop, and socially engaged lyrics, the pioneering Argentinian artist Alika is a pillar of the Latin American dancehall scene and a champion of the fight against injustice and violence in the <em>barrios</em> of her country.

organization centered on a trio of mute performers that present themselves in blue paint, latex bald caps, and black clothing. Friends Chris Wink, Matt Goldman and Phil Stanton (collectively referred to as CMP) conceived the idea during the 1980s while in New York City. They began appearing on the streets in Blue Man regalia, entertaining passersby, staging unusual events such as “The Funeral For the 80s”, and short bits in Tom Murrin’s “The Alien Comic’s” underground cabarets in “The CLUB” at La MaMa Experimental Theater Club. Meryl Vladimer, then Artistic Director of “The CLUB,” liked what she saw in their work and commissioned Blue Man Group to create a full-length show. The resulting piece, “TUBES,” took off after Vladimer persuaded The New York Times critic Stephen Holden to review it. Blue Man Group’s popularity continued to snowball, eventually winning CMP an Obie Award and a “Lucille Lortel” Award, which led producers to take the show to off-Broadway. “TUBES” opened in 1991 at the Astor Place Theater. This critically acclaimed show, as well as frequent appearances on The Tonight Show, enabled CMP and Blue Man Group team to open similar productions and expand their concepts into other kinds of performances.  In June of 2007, they expanded to open a theater exclusively for the BMP (formerly Nickelodeon Studios) at Universal Studios Florida in Orlando, Florida, performing two shows daily.  In 1999, the group released their first audio recording, appropriately titled Audio. Although it contained some of the music from their stage productions, it was less of a soundtrack and more a collection of full-length instrumentals that featured new instruments.","startTime":1527089400,"cityName":"New York","postalCode":"10003","url":"http://newyorkcity.eventful.com/events/blue-man-group-/E0-001-053390220-5@2018052311?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"title":"Stomp","venueUrl":"http://newyorkcity.eventful.com/venues/orpheum-theater-/V0-001-000112307-9?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","latitude":40.7281952,"regionName":"New York","imageURL":"http://d1marr3m5x4iac.cloudfront.net/images/large/I0-001/000/686/346-4.jpeg_/stomp-46.jpeg","venueName":"Orpheum Theater","id":"E0-001-036912981-6@2018052311","countryName":"United States","longitude":-73.9875022,"venueAddress":"126 2nd Avenue","desc":"","startTime":1527087600,"cityName":"New York","postalCode":"10003","url":"http://newyorkcity.eventful.com/events/stomp-/E0-001-036912981-6@2018052311?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"title":"Aladdin","venueUrl":"http://newyorkcity.eventful.com/venues/new-amsterdam-theatre-/V0-001-000112293-7?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","latitude":40.7560871,"regionName":"New York","imageURL":"//d1marr3m5x4iac.cloudfront.net/images/large/I0-001/040/328/845-7.jpeg_/aladdin-45.jpeg","venueName":"New Amsterdam Theatre","id":"E0-001-093769221-6@2018052313","countryName":"United States","longitude":-73.987937,"venueAddress":"214 West 42nd Street","desc":"New Amsterdam Theatre\nNew York, NY \tFri, Dec 30 2016\n8:00 PM","startTime":1527094800,"cityName":"New York","postalCode":"10036","url":"http://newyorkcity.eventful.com/events/aladdin-/E0-001-093769221-6@2018052313?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"title":"The Lion King","venueUrl":"http://newyorkcity.eventful.com/venues/minskoff-theatre-/V0-001-000223922-5?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","latitude":40.7580227,"regionName":"New York","imageURL":"http://d1marr3m5x4iac.cloudfront.net/images/large/I0-001/014/568/235-1.jpeg_/the-lion-king-35.jpeg","venueName":"Minskoff Theatre","id":"E0-001-097929722-4@2018052313","countryName":"United States","longitude":-73.986025,"venueAddress":"200 West 45th Street","desc":"The Lion King\nMinskoff Theatre, New York, NY","startTime":1527094800,"cityName":"New York","postalCode":"10036","url":"http://newyorkcity.eventful.com/events/lion-king-/E0-001-097929722-4@2018052313?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"title":"Perfect Crime","venueUrl":"http://newyorkcity.eventful.com/venues/the-snapple-theater-center-anne-l-bernstein-t-/V0-001-000170565-1?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","latitude":40.7615436,"regionName":"New York","imageURL":"http://d1marr3m5x4iac.cloudfront.net/images/large/I0-001/035/101/847-2.jpeg_/perfect-crime-47.jpeg","venueName":"The Snapple Theater Center - Anne L.

Johnson Museum of Art at Cornell University and the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston.Pouran Jinchi in her Tajvid works presents faithful representation of the pronunciation marks and the Suraand Aya (Chapter and Verse) markers from pages of different Qorans. What she leaves out is the text itself. In keeping with the Qoran as the word of God, Tajvid refers to the proper pronunciation, phrasing and attitude in reading holy words. The diacritical marks Jinchi has rendered are not used in everyday Arabic writing where they would be extraneous but their use in the Qoran is critical in helping the reader precisely emulate the sound of divine speech. In Jinchi’s paintings, though, the words are gone; what was an indicator of the way to holiness now becomes a code without a subject. Jinchi further emphasizes the formal beauty of the disembodied communication by keying each painting to a color: blue, yellow, green.Pouran Jinchi (b.1959, Mashad, Iran) lives and works in New York.

Barbara Kruger’s battle cry: “Your Body Is a Battleground” has never been truer. What has changed is that we are no longer content to simply offer our coy laments about the treatment of women by men in power. Perhaps for the first time in history, women are banding together, speaking out, using the legal system to bring their abusers to stand public trials, supporting one another as we move forward to a new era of feminism, equality and a future where our daughters will no longer feel afraid and be treated on par with their male counterparts. What is the role, the power, the future of the female body? What is the ideal feminine?\n \nThis show proposes to use the gallery as a platform to examine the way artists, mostly female, sees the female body as the ideal feminine. Can a female body be an ideal? What is that feminine ideal? Does it exist? Does it attract, repel, and exhibit strength, weakness? What are our expectations for the feminine ideal? Twelve artists have been invited to participate in the Ideal Feminine? show, each dealing with the notion of the female form in an individual way through a variety of materials, techniques, styles and interpretations. \n \nStephanie Hirsch, Sissi Farassat and Zoë Buckman use materials often associated with woman’s work such as embroidery and beads to express their femininity and expand the notion of craft through their artistic process. Hirsch covers her work entirely with beads, creating a sort of protective skin on top of the sculptures. Her works present a decorative visual appeal but also a calm and resolute toughness. Sissi Farassat photographs women’s bodies, including her own, as a first step of the artistic process. She then laboriously hand embroiders thread and beads on top of the photograph, thus extending the singular moment of a photographic snapshot into a lengthy and time consuming embellishment period, evoking the historic craft form associated with women. Zoë Buckman boldly takes on the subject of feminism through appropriation of objects as varied as boxing gloves and mannequin legs to change the course of the dialogue and highlight uncomfortable truths while proposing her version of what the future holds. On stockings, Buckman hand-embroiders hip-hop lyrics that jarringly juxtapose misogyny and liberal ideas inherent in pop culture to this day.\n \nJen Ray and Jessica Lichtenstein both challenge the patriarchal system by presenting a world where women exist as warriors, amazons, frolicking maidens in a female-dominant environment oblivious that life can be led in any other way. Jen Ray, a multimedia artist and performer, arms her warrior women with flower-encrusted porcelain battle axes and sends them to stand strong, independent and unwavering against any omnipotent male-dominated system.   Jessica Lichtenstein activates and releases her female protagonists to populate their own idealistic natural world, filling every tree, lake and field, and replacing the leaves and flowers with their figures unabashedly enjoying this liberated existence. Her wall sculptures in acrylic, metal-leaf and lacquer hark back to the past and evoke some fantasy landscapes conceived by male artists, but make no mistake; Lichtensteins’ girls exist and flourish only on their own terms. \n \nMargeaux Walter and Lala Abaddon both use photography to express what it means to capture their own female body, to be a woman, and to use performance as a means for individual expression. Walter photographs herself performing various actions, experiencing environments she creates, and questioning the meaning of existence. Abaddon performs, photographs and weaves the photographed images into a complex tapestry of sorts that evokes the original performance and the body but also abstracts the action and the form. Abaddon’s work is transformative both for the way it translates her own experience through the performance and the way that action becomes embodied in photographed and sculptured works. Abaddon will also create an original performance during the show wrapping herself into a cocoon and capturing her naked form inside the self-made structure. \n \nRachel Lee Hovnanian and Natasha Law present the female form as sculpted and painted ideals but from very different points of view.  Rachel Hovnanian is a multi-media artist reflecting on the current culture, assessing and engaging with its standards and norms.  Hovnanian's poignancy lies in her uncanny ability to take the most obvious truisms and turn them on their head with humor and brilliant re-contextualization.  For the current show, Hovnanian will have two sculptural works that question the nature of the female body norms artificially conceived and by which women are still being judged to this day both in the media and throughout popular culture. On the other hand, the British painter Natasha Law paints women’s bodies in their casual, relaxed and intimate state.  Though anonymous, the bodies she captures in the midst of undressing or simply bending over are those of her girlfriends and the gaze is that of a female artist.  Her women are sexy without being sexualized. \n \nThe three male artists in the show have been invited to share in their own perspective on the significance of the female form. Todd Murphy gathers found materials, particularly those from the natural world such as flowers or twigs to compose female dress forms he sculpts and photographs. These feminine shapes are poetic and fairy-tale like asking the viewer to suspend reality and imagine a dress made for a princess, a goddess, a fairy, a dancer or the woman of his ideal feminine. \n \nMarc Dennis’s hyperrealist painting done in the Old Master technique of artists such as Carravagio, embraces subjects as diverse as still-life to tattooed divas and portraits of powerful gallerists. But for the current show, Dennis presents paintings of two young women, one seen frontally and one from the back of her head and neck. The paintings are so realistic the viewer can mistake them for photographs however they are also authentic and honest in their embrace of female beauty and strength as seen through a man’s gaze. \n \nSebastiaan Bremer utilizes both photography and painting in his work. Each photograph in the exhibition is uniquely enhanced by tiny ink droplets that reimagine images of the female bodies, initially captured in a fragment of a moment. Bremer either uses his own photographed figures or images derived from his art historical predecessors, such as Pablo Picasso. He reinterprets the image, creating a different tone that tackles the ideas of a central female protagonist in a dreamlike world.","startTime":1527112800,"status":"live","url":"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-ideal-femininethe-feminine-ideal-tickets-46253956830?aff=ebapi"},{"isReservedSeating":false,"locale":"en_US","isOnlineEvent":false,"subCategoryId":"5008","venuId":"23770185","stopTime":1527118200,"isLocked":false,"name":"Critical Walk-Through | Kamau Ware of Black Gotham Experience","currency":"USD","imageURL":"https://img.evbuc.com/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F42523870%2F49636562654%2F1%2Foriginal.jpg?h=200&w=450&auto=compress&rect=0%2C212%2C1800%2C900&s=d77c58ecb64446a88398667bfee40b65","venu":{"fullAddress":"47-29 32nd Place, Long Island City, NY 11101","address":"47-29 32nd Place","city":"Long Island City","id":"23770185","country":"US","lon":-73.93329990000001,"postalCode":"11101","lat":40.742708,"region":"NY","name":"Self-Taught Genius Gallery"},"id":"44406989501","vanityURL":"","desc":"These 40-minute guided tours of Holding Space: The Museum Collects are led by artists, writers, and scholars, who bring new insights to the exhibition’s artworks and themes.

And is our adoption of tech and devices just providing us with new avenues of excess and impropriety? Tiffany Shlain and Nigel Savage talk idolatry in the age of the iPhone. This program is part of a spring program series exploring the Ten Commandments at Eldridge Street. Presented in partnership with Limmud NY.\nTiffany Shlain is an Emmy-nominated filmmaker and author. She is the founder of The Webby Awards, and co-founder of two global initiatives, Character Day and 50/50 Day–unified days of film and discussion about important issues shaping our lives that unite over 100,000 live events.  Her films included her feature documentary Connected, The Tribe, which explores American Jewish identity through the history of the Barbie doll and The Making of Mensch​​.​ ​She serves on the Leadership Board of The Center on Media and Child Health at Harvard’s Boston Children’s Hospital and she is a Henry Crown Fellow of The Aspen Institute.​ ​Tiffany and her husband​ ​and​ two children have turned off all screens for one day a week for what they call their “Tech Shabbats​”​ for the past 8 years​ which she ​is currently writing a book about and has explored in her films.\nNigel Savage founded Hazon in 2000, with a mission to create a healthier and more sustainable Jewish community, and a healthier and more sustainable world for everyone. Nigel has spoken, taught, or written for a wide and significant range of audiences. He has twice been named a member of the Forward 50, the annual list of the 50 most influential Jewish people in the United States, and is a recipient of the Bernard Reisman Award.

You learn to trust your gut, you learn to trust your ear, and most of all, you learn to trust your company. Fortunately for us, here in 2017 Mr. Finley has all three in spades.The singer lives in the tiny, forgotten town of Bernice, Louisiana, right near the Arkansas line, but in his younger days his music took him all over the world. Joining the Army as a teenager, Finley was sent to Europe as a helicopter technician but found more appealing work as the leader of the Army band, and toured the continent many times over on guitar and vocals. Following his rambling military service, he learned the trade of carpentry and settled back home in the States. He leaned on his gospel and blues songs for a hobby rather than career, and mostly confined his artistry to the streets of the South. But now, in the true spirit of the American Dream, Finleys music is once again primed to reach doors and shores at home and abroad, as his new LP Goin Platinum! is set to be released through Dan Auerbachs Easy Eye Sound this fall. Finley, who has lost most of his eyesight and was recently forced to retire from carpentering, is a self-taught musician who started writing his own songs at age 10. Learning to play by ear, he developed a unique personal style that continues to serve him well today. When you train yourself by ear you dont always get the chords as perfect as they should beand sometimes you stumble upon a better chord, he says. It really is a never-ending process; Im constantly learning, and theres always room for improvement. Ive been playing for about 52 years; if youre satisfied with everything you do, that dont leave no room to grow. But the main thing, I got a great team putting this stuff together. God blessed me with the voice, but the connections are getting me in the right place at the right time in front of the right people, so I can display what I got.Its that kind of team-player attitude that has helped rejuvenate his career. A few years back, Finley was playing some R & B songs to a street crowd in Arkansas when he met a member of the Music Maker Foundation, an organization that provides direct support to older and underprivileged musicians.
